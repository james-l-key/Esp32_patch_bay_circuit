# Output directories (Gerbers, Drill files, Pick and Place, etc.)
# It's common to generate these and commit them as a release artifact,
# but often the *directory* itself is ignored, and only specific output
# files are added when a release is made.
# If you always generate them locally and don't commit them, uncomment these:
# gerbers/
# drill/
# bom/
# output/
# fab/

# macOS specific files
.DS_Store
